						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The short version goes: Debbie Strutton and Ross Kirk met in Fort Collins, Colorado at their singles group at Mountain View Community Church. They went on wild scavenger hunts and snowshoeing adventures—they trained for and completed a sprint triathlon, climbed mountains, prayed together, encouraged each other, laughed a lot -- and fell in love.</p>

								<hr>
								
								<h3 class="major">The long story</h3>
								
								<p>The longer story (here weaved from Debbie’s and Ross’s own words, solicited separately and unseen by each other): 

								<p>When asked about their first date, the beginning sentence of the narrative began the same in both versions:

								<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> “I first asked her out at a gas station (romantic, I know).”
								<br/><strong>DEBBIE:</strong> “He asked me out at a gas station.” 

								<p>They’d met up at the gas station to exchange a cell phone that Ross offered to bring to Debbie to take to her sister in China, a trip Debbie left for the next day. Outside the hybrid gas station/asian market on Jefferson Street, Ross asked if Debbie would go to dinner with him when she returned almost three weeks later. 

								<p>Of course, thankfully, the story continues from there. Before the gas station, Debbie and Ross got to know each other through church and friends. Debbie, ever modest and charmingly oblivious, discussed her surprise at Ross’s interest in her: 

								<blockquote>“Our conversations at our church group included several distinct questions like, ‘What kinds of activities do you enjoy?’ and ‘Tell me about yourself.’ His sudden interest surprised me because, while he'd been coming to our church group for about nine months, we hung out with different folks, so I knew of him, but didn't know him. The only reason we'd started seeing more of each other that December was because I was randomly invited to his surprise 30th birthday party, an escape room, by my now roommate (thanks, Kim!), who just wanted to avoid being the only girl at the party. Then, when I copied that escape room idea a month later for my 30th birthday, I invited him, along with a few of the other friends who had done that first room with us, mostly for his experience with successfully escaping the last room. I had no idea how thrilled he was.”
								</blockquote>
								
								<p>That birthday party, in fact, gave Ross the idea to take Debbie out to her favorite restaurant, “one of the clue locations dating back to her birthday party across-town scavenger hunt maze at her favorite Thai place, Cafe de Bangkok in Fort Collins.” Debbie confesses, “he offered to take me to my favorite Thai restaurant in town, which was highly motivating.” 

								<p>Ross described the joyful chaos of their meal: “The wait staff moved us all over the place to three different tables, and she happened to splash noodle soup all over me at least twice —perfect appearance went out the window immediately.” The night ended with their talking for hours in a Jazz Club over Syrah. Of that evening, Ross recalls,  “all I know is that it felt so perfectly natural being with her, so pure, so peaceful, and she was so lovely. We then started a tradition of walking to and fro around old town, warming cold limbs over the fire.”  

								<p>Debbie, too, expressed similar ease after their first few dates: “His surprising talkativeness and ridiculous dad jokes, half-brown left eye, and obvious confidence in Christ lured me into the second and third date. The decidedly lacking need to ‘play the game’ with him, substituted by clear and intentional communication and unabashed but well-tempered affection for me, totally won me over for the fourth. Shortly thereafter, my roommate started making fun of me, and rightfully so. <strong>I was literally skipping.</strong>

								<p>As their relationship continued, they began to see more in each other and began to feel more certain that they would get married. For Ross, this confirmation came through the “myriad ways she went out of her way to care for me—care packages came with her to my office unannounced, she lent her helping hands when I had to move homes, even accompanied me to an urgent care appointment.” He reflected on how “she carries with her what I call a ‘confident humility’, loves deeply from her heart all her family, and how she tangibly loves and serves her many deep friends. I came to know and see the beauty that wells up inside her heart and spills over to the outside.” 

								<p>Debbie shared similar certainty: “He's smart, goofy, dashingly handsome, enjoys the outdoors, loves music, loves my family, loves Jesus, leads humbly, prioritizes the church body, excels in pretty much all the fruits of the Spirit, he's thoughtful, generous, serves without question, and he compliments my sometimes brash and apathetic personality with prudence and empathy.” 

								<p>Their travels together also secured their affection and intention: 

								<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> “We traveled to California, Utah, Florida, Aspen, Poudre Canyon, Estes Park, and to our favorite spot by Horsetooth Rock.  I've seen how the Lord's moved in both of our hearts and carefully crafted a special love for us in each other.”
								<p><strong>DEBBIE:</strong> “Sometime between watching Ross interact with my family last summer, and traveling with him to visit his family in California in the fall, I became sure I would marry him.” 

								<p>Of their upcoming marriage, they expressed gratitude and excitement:

								<h4>Ross</h4>
								<blockquote> “I've known for some time how much much I wanted to be with her, now with the expectant joy ahead of being together "forever earthed" (knowing marriage lasts not beyond death) seeking to love one another and enjoy the mysteries that follow to the praise of His glorious name.”
								</blockquote>
								<h4>Debbie: </h4>
								<blockquote>"I've always felt relatively happy as a single woman. God's given me purpose, plenty of friends, a loving family, nieces and nephews to care for, and I don't feel I've been missing out on something by not being married. I don't think marriage is superior to singleness, because you can serve the Lord in either capacity. However, I do think that when a believer finds another believer who supports them no matter what, and makes them want to love Jesus more, marrying that person is the only way to go.”
								</blockquote>
								<p>Debbie and Ross so look forward to celebrating this story, His story, and all the other stories that will follow after at their wedding this July.
